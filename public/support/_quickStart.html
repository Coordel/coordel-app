			<p>Coordel let’s you create tasks that clearly structure your work. When working with others, it let’s you tie tasks together into Coords (kôrds), to coordinate the work you do together. </p>
			<p>Current - tasks in this list are tasks you can do now.</p>
			<p>Deferred - tasks in this list are tasks that start sometime in the future. If you finish the Tasks in the Current list, then you can get started on the Deferred list.</p>
			<p>Delegated - these are tasks that you have Delegated to someone else. These can be individual tasks that come up or they are tasks you have Delegated in a Coord when you aren't the Coord Responsible. If you have finished all of your Current and Deferred tasks, you can get started working on Delegated Tasks.</p>
			<p>Blocked - tasks in this list can't start until some other task is complete. When the task this task is waiting on is complete, the latest version of the Deliverable will be in this task so you don't have to search for it.</p>
			<p>Private - tasks in this list belong to you and no one else will see them.</p>

			<p>A challenge in the past was how to handle new and changing work. Coordel structures how you send and receive invitations to do work, and how you agree what work you will do.</p>

			<p>Another challenge is to know who is going to do what. Coordel automates delegation of tasks so everyone knows who has accepted a task and what they will do with that task. If changes are required, they can be made on-the-fly and everyone in the Coord is kept up to date.</p>

			<p>Issues come up. Coordel ensures that when an issue is raised, the right person is responsible for clearing it and getting the task back on track.</p>

			<p>Approvals. When are we done? When the person responsible for the work says we are. Coordel automates how the approval process happens.</p>

			<p>And with built-in notifications for whenever anything happens, you will always be on top of all things in your work</p>

		<h2>Be Explicit about Deliverables</h2>

			<p>Either decide yourself or let the person doing the Task decide, but agree what will be delivered.</p>
			<p>When you create a task, you can decide what the Deliverable is. The current version of Coordel has several Deliverable types:</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Checkbox List - this is to allow for multiple choices. Also use this Deliverable if you want to have the user click a single checkbox like Approved, I Agree, or some other single entry.</li>
					<li>Dropdown List - this is to give a drop down box that allows for a single choice</li>
					<li>File - use this Deliverable type if the user needs to upload a file of some kind. Versions will be tracked each time a user uploads and saves.</li>
					<li>Radio List - use this if you want to let the user choose one of several options.</li>
					<li>Textarea - this is a container of multiple lines of text. Versions are tracked each time the user saves.</li>
					<li>Textbox - this is a container of a single line of text</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Using these deliverable types will cover many different scenarios. Contact <a href="mailto:info@coordel.com">&nbsp;</a> Coordel if you need to integrate with other systems. It's a simple process to integrate with Cloud services if required</p>

			<h2>Coordinate Tasks with Blockers</h2>

			<p>When you know someone else needs to do something before you can do your Task, set a Blocker and forget it. Coordel will notify you immediately when the other Task is done!</p>
			<p>In the past you would send and email and wait to hear back. Several follow-up emails and a phone call later, you would get the response only to have to send a few more emails or call again to see where the final Deliverable exists.</p>
			<p>With Coordel, send a task with an explicit Deliverable (file, textarea, dropdown) and then set it as a blocker to your task. Then, as soon as the person is done with what you're waiting for, you'll get notified right away and you'll know exactly where the Deliverable is.</p>
			
			<p>If there are steps a person doing a task needs to take, use internal blockers to make that happen.</p>
