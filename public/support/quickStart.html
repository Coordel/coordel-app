			<p>A challenge in the past was how to handle new and changing work. Coordel structures how you send and receive invitations to do work, and how you agree what work you will do.</p>

			<p>It has been a challenge in the past to know who is going to do what. Coordel automates delegation of tasks so everyone know who has accepted a task and what they will do with that task. If changes are required, they can be made on-the-fly and everyone in the Coord is kept up to date.</p>

			<p>Issues come up. Coordel ensures that when an issue is raised, the right person is responsible for clearing it and getting the task back on track.</p>

			<p>Approvals. When are we done? When the person responsible for the work says we are. Coordel automates how the approval process happens.</p>

			<p>And with built-in notifications for whenever anything happens, you will always be on top of all things in your work</p>
