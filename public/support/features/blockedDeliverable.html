  <p>Sometimes, there are different steps to getting even a simple task done. Use Coordel to define the order in which a task will be executed. </p>
  <p>When delegating a task to someone else, you can make sure the correct order is followed by indicating which steps within the task are blocked by others. The same applies for the tasks you are working on yourself. Just edit the task and define which deliverables are blocking others. When you go to the <a href="/?p=feature&f=workspace">Workspace</a> of that task, only unblocked deliverables can be worked on. When you have completed one step, click save, and the next step will appear. Watch the header of the <a href="/?p=feature&f=workspace">Workspace</a> to see how many total steps there are.</p>
