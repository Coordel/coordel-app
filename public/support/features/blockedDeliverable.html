  <p>Sometimes, there are different steps to getting even a simple task done. Use Coordel to define the order in which a task's deliverables (or steps) will be executed.</p>
  <p>When creating a task or delegating one to someone else, you can make sure the task's steps are executed in the correct order by indicating what deliverables block others. When you go to the <a href="/?p=feature&f=workspace">Task Workspace</a> of that task, only unblocked deliverables can be worked on. When you have completed one step, click "Save," and the next step will appear. Watch the header of the <a href="/?p=feature&f=workspace">Task Workspace</a> to see how many total steps there are.</p>
