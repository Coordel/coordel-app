  <p>No more “Are you done yet?” Coordel lets you define the tasks that are blocking your work. It notifies you immediately when your team members are done with their part and you have everything you need to get started.</p>
  <p>Coordel is designed to let you automate your own work. In order to automate, you need a simple way to know what you can do. If you, or someone else, must complete one task before you can start work on another, the first task is blocking the second. </p>
  <p>Most of the time, we don’t know the order of tasks right away. With Coordel, you add them as you think of them, along with any blocking between tasks. Coordel automatically manages the order of execution, including the blocking prerequisites. </p>
  <p>Click on the Blocked List to see all the tasks that you have agreed to but that are blocked by others. As you or someone else complete blocking tasks, the tasks they blocked automatically move into your <a href="/?p=feature&f=current">Current</a> list. No more following up, calling or e-mailing, especially because the deliverables from the blocking tasks have moved into your Workspace automatically. No more “What’s the latest version of that document?” or “Could you resend that?” What you need is there. </p>
