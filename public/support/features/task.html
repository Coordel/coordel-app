  <p>You have worked with e-mail for too long. You know how it goes... You outline what needs to happen in an e-mail and hit send. And then confusion and miscommunication happens. In today’s work environment, we need more than a free text field that leaves too much room for inefficiencies. Enter Coordel Tasks. With just a few clicks, everything you and your team need to do your work is right there in front of you: </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Purpose</strong> – define what you expect to happen.</li>
    <li><strong>Deadline</strong> – enter when the Task needs to be done. If you don't set a specific deadline, it will default to the deadline of the Coord it is part of.</li>
    <li><strong>Coord</strong> - assign it to a Coord or create a new one </li>
    <li><strong><a href="/?p=feature&f=delegated">Delegate</a></strong>  - give it to one of your existing contacts, or a new one. Or leave the field blank to do the Task yourself.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="/?p=feature&f=deferred">Defer</a></strong> – set the start date of the task to sometime in the future.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="/?p=feature&f=deliverable">Deliverables</a></strong> – define the Task deliverables if you know what needs to be done and how. Or you can leave it up to the person doing to task to specify the deliverables.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="/?p=feature&f=blocked">Blockers</a></strong> – select the Tasks in this or other Coords that need to be completed before this Task can be started.</li>
    <li><strong>Attachments</strong> – attach the files that complete the briefing for this Task.</li>
  </ol>
