  <p>Coordel is packed with features. But using it is very simple because it’s real advantage is how it has smartened up tasks.</p>
  <p>You know how it is. You send an e-mail and expect something to happen…but it often doesn’t. Not because email is broken, but because it’s too generic. Write some text…any text…and it’s good to go. In today’s work environment, we need more.</p>
  <p>With Coordel, when you think of clicking the new e-mail button, think to send a task instead.  The Task Form is very powerful, but you don’t have to enter anything (not even a name). Here’s what you can enter:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Purpose</strong> – enter what you expect to happen</li>
    <li><strong>Deadline</strong> – enter when this task needs to be done (defaults to the Coord deadline). Using deadline rather than priority ensures everyone is on the same page.</li>
    <li><strong>Coord</strong> - assign it to a Coord or create a new one </li>
    <li><strong><a href="/?p=feature&f=delegated">Delegate</a></strong>  - assign it to one of your existing contacts, create and assign it to a new contact, or leave it blank to do it yourself</li>
    <li><strong><a href="/?p=feature&f=deferred">Defer</a></strong> – set the start date of the task to sometime in the future</li>
    <li><strong><a href="/?p=feature&f=deliverable">Deliverables</a></strong> – if you know what needs to be delivered, you can define it now but you can leave it up to the person doing to task to define it</li>
    <li><strong><a href="/?p=feature&f=blocked">Blockers</a></strong> – if one or more tasks have deliverables you need to do this task, select them as blockers…even in other Coords</li>
    <li><strong>Attachments</strong> – if there are files you need to do this task, attach them here</li>
  </ol>

  <p><a href="/register" style="color: #00629b">Try it</a>. Filling out the form is simple, structured, and helps you think of everything required to guarantee the task gets done…in the same amount of time you needed to write an e-mail.</p>
  <p>Now when you look at the list of features, you’ll see what Coordel does to make you and people you work with as productive as possible. All you have to do is send a task rather than an e-mail!</p>
