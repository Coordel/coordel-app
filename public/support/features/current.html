  <p>What’s next? Your Coordel Current list is the first thing you see when you log into Coordel. It automatically gathers the unblocked tasks you have agreed to, so you can easily decide on what to do next. It’s your always-up-to-date, automated to do list, without distractions.</p>

  <p>Only those tasks that you can work on will be shown in your Current list. That way, you are not distracted by tasks you have delegated to someone else, tasks you have deferred to a later date or tasks you can’t start yet because you are waiting for someone else to finish.</p>
  
  <p>Tasks in the Current list are sorted by deadline, with the earliest at the top. If one task on the list needs to be prioritized, just move the deadline up, down to the minute.</p>
  
  <p>If your Current list is so long you don’t know where to start, you can apply the “Getting Things Done” methodology. Run the <a href="/?p=feature&f=turbo">Turbo Wizard</a> to zip through your Current list and get your day started efficiently.</p>
