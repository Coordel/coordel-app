  <p>How much time do you spend looking for that e-mail or file? Coordel gives you one Workspace where you plan, execute and deliver your work. From the briefing to the deliverables, it’s all there, neatly organized in one overview.</p>

  <p>Coordel’s Task Workspace is designed to help you manage your work. A simple click on a task title will bring you to its Workspace.</p>

  <p>The top of the Task Workspace features the information about the task, including its purpose and the Coord it is part of. Briefing documents can also be attached to the Task Workspace so they are always in the same place. </p>

  <p>If a task has blockers, they will be listed below the Task Info. If a blocker has been completed, you will see the final version of its deliverables you can now work with. </p>

  <p>When you are assigned a task, the first step is to clarify the deliverables. Click the "Edit" button to add, update or remove deliverables or <a href="/?p=feature&f=blockedDeliverable">Blocked Deliverables</a>.</p>

  <p>Under the <a href="/?p=feature&f=deliverable">Deliverables</a> are the tasks you are<a href="/?p=feature&f=blocked">blocking</a> until your deliverables are complete.</p>

  <p>Finally, you can plan what needs to happen to complete this task’s deliverables. The right column of the Task Workspace has three supporting tabs–</p>
  <div class="et-custom-list etlist-dot indent">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Task Checklist</strong> – where you can make a list of things you need to do to finish the task. There is a mini version of the <a href="/?p=feature&f=turbo">Turbo Wizard</a> available for you to run on Checklists. You can use the "Show Checklist" option in your Current list to see the Checklist under each task.</li>
    <li><strong>Notes</strong> – where you keep can your notes about a task. </li>
    <li><strong>Task Stream</strong> – where you can enter messages for the other Coord members.</li>
  </ul>
