  <p>Coordel allows you to accept, propose changes to, or decline new work.</p>
  
  <p>There are two types of invitations, to Coords and to tasks.</p>
  
  <p>You can be invited to follow a Coord. In this case you are not asked (yet) to do any work. You can also be asked to actively participate in a Coord.</p>
  
  <p>When you get invited to do a task, you can accept the task if you agree with its scope and if it fits into your <a href="/?p=feature&f=deadline">Deadline Calendar</a>. Or you can explicitly decline it. </p>
  
  <p>You can also propose changes to the purpose, the deadline or the deliverables of the task. Very often, task definitions are unclear or incomplete. Coordel allows you to propose changes before you accept a task. The delegator can either agree with your changes or amend the changes. This back and forth can continue until both of you agree and you accept the task, or you canâ€™t agree and you decline the task. Either way, there is no room for confusion about what you have said yes to.</p>
