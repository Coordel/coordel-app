  <p>The Deadline Calendar shows all your Coord and task deadlines. When you get a new <a href="/?p=feature&f=invite">invitation</a>, you can quickly look at your Deadline Calendar and decide if you can accept it or if you should propose a time when you can participate. Coordel even highlights where the new Coord or task fits into the Calendar. How’s that for productive?</p>
  <p>Deadlines are fundamental to how Coordel works. Every Coord has a deadline. If you don’t give it a deadline, it will default to seven days from now. All new tasks have a deadline as well. If one isn’t provided, Coordel uses the deadline of its Coord.</p>
  <p>Working to a deadline helps eliminate miscommunication. When you set a Coord or task deadline, there is no room for confusion. If one of your tasks needs to be prioritized before another, you can set the deadline sooner, down to the minute. </p>
  <p>Working with others sometimes means your work is blocked while you wait for someone else to finish. Coordel lets you set task <a href="/?p=feature&f=blocked">blockers</a>. Any time a task is blocked, it is indicated on the Deadline Calendar. That way, if your deadline is approaching and your task is still blocked, you are not caught by surprise.</p>
