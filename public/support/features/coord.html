  <p>Unsurprisingly, Coordel is built on Coords. Coords are how you go from setting to achieving a goal through a series of tasks executed by a team of experts. Coords bring communication, agreements, productivity, transparency and accountability to the process.</p>

  <p>Coords enable you to get work started and completed -with one or more other people- in just a few clicks.</p>
  
  <p>When you start a Coord, you will have the following options to complete. No fields are mandatory but some default to values when not provided:</p>
  
  <div class="et-custom-list etlist-dot indent">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> – enter the name of this Coord (defaults to 'No Name')</li>
    <li><strong>Purpose</strong> – enter what you want to accomplish</li>
    <li><strong>Deadline</strong> – enter the deadline of the Coord. All tasks in the Coord will default to this deadline (defaults to seven days from now)</li>
    <li><strong>Responsible</strong> – enter the person responsible for the successful completion of the tasks in the Coord (defaults to you)</li>
    <li><strong>People</strong> – enter any people who will be invited to follow the Coord</li>
    <li><strong>Roles</strong> – enter any people who will be invited to participate in the Coord
  </ol>
  <ul style="margin-left: 3em">
    <li><strong>Role Name</strong> – enter the name of the Role this participant will have</li>
    <li><strong>Person</strong> – enter the name of a Person entered in People</li>
  </ul>
  <ol start="7">
    </li>
    <li><strong>Defer</strong> – enter the date when the Coord will start</li>
    <li><strong>Attachments</strong> – upload any files that everyone in the Coord will need like templates, samples, etc</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  
  <p>When you need to accomplish something, but aren’t exactly sure how, just start a Coord. Add <a href="/?p=feature&f=people" class="c-color-active">People</a> who have the skills you need and use the <a href="/?p=feature&f=stream">Stream</a> to discuss how to meet your objective. The task or series of tasks that are needed to reach the goal will emerge from your back-and-forth with these experts.</p>

  <p>Coords are designed to coordinate the work <a href="/?p=feature&f=people" class="c-color-active">People</a> do, and to distribute the authority and responsibility needed to ensure everyone is highly productive and to make progress transparent automatically.</p>
