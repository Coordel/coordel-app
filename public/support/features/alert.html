  <p>With Coordel, you don’t miss a thing. When a task or Coord you are involved in changes, an audio and visual alert lets you know.</p>

  <p>The "Alerts" box in the top banner of your Coordel screen keeps you informed of what happened and gives you direct access to the changed task or Coord. Afterwards, you simply clear your Alerts list.</p>

  <p>Even when you’re not logged on, Coordel will track your alerts so they are waiting for you when you check in.</p>
