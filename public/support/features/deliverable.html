  <p>“I thought you were going to deliver a spreadsheet.” “Weren’t you going to include the status in that document?” Coordel knows how easily misunderstandings happen about the type of output team members are going to generate. </p>
  
  <p>Turning expectations and assumptions into agreements, Coordel comes with explicit deliverable types built into <a href="/?p=feature&f=task" class="c-color-active">Tasks</a>. Both the Coord responsible and the person executing the task know exactly what output is expected when the task is completed. Coordel comes with the following built-in deliverables - </p>
  <div class="et-custom-list etlist-dot indent">
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Text box</strong> – the output will be a pre-defined field.</li>
  <li><strong>Textarea</strong> – the output is one or more paragraphs of text. Coordel keeps older versions of your text with each save.</li>
  <li><strong>Checkbox list</strong> – the output is one or multiple choices from a list.</li>
  <li><strong>Radio list</strong> – the output is one of multiple choices from a list.</li>
  <li><strong>Dropdown list</strong> – like the Radio list, the output is one of multiple choices from a list.</li>
  <li><strong>File</strong> – the output is a submitted file. Coordel creates a version each time a new file is submitted.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <p>When you add a deliverable to a task, you can give it a name and provide instructions on how the deliverable should be completed. You can also indicate whether it is required. Until values are provided for required deliverables, the task owner can’t mark the task "Done."</p>
  <p>Once deliverables are defined for a task, the resulting work will always be exactly where it should be, the task’s <a href="/?p=feature&f=workspace">Workspace</a>. No more looking for versions of that one document in your inbox or servers. When the work is done, go to the "Deliverables" view of the Coord and see a list of all its deliverables in one place. </p>
