  <p>“I thought you were going to deliver a spreadsheet.” “Weren’t you going to include the status in that document?” Coordel knows how easily misunderstandings happen about the type of output team members are going to generate. </p>
  <p>Turning expectations and assumptions into agreements, Coordel comes with explicit deliverable types built into the task Workspace so that both Coord responsible and the person executing the task know exactly what output is expected upon completion of the task:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Text box</strong> – at the end of the task, the output will be entered into a pre-defined field. </li>
  <li><strong>Textarea</strong> – use the text area when the deliverable is one or more paragraphs of text. Coordel keeps older versions when a new iteration is saved in the text area.</li>
  <li><strong>Checkbox List</strong> – pre-define a checkbox list if the result of a task is one or multiple choices from a list. </li>
  <li><strong>Radio List</strong> – If the result of a task is just one of multiple choices from a list, you can pre-define a radio list in Coordel </li>
  <li><strong>Dropdown List</strong> – A dropdown deliverable option allows choices to be fully customized.</li>
  <li><strong>File</strong> – When the result of a task is a file, choose the upload button so that files can be submitted.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Add an explanation about the type of file and its expected content. Coordel creates a version each time a new file is submitted into the Workspace.</p>
  <p>When you add a deliverable to a task, you can give it a name and provide instructions on how the deliverable should be completed. You can also indicate whether it is required. Until values are provided for required deliverables, the task owner can’t mark the task done.</p>
  <p>Once deliverables are defined for a task, the resulting work will always be exactly where it should be, the task’s Workspace [LINK TO WORKSPACE]. No more looking for versions of that one document in your inbox or servers. When the work is done, go to the Deliverables view of the Coord and see a list of all its deliverables in one place. </p>
