  <p>Don't get overwhelmed by the work on your plate. Turbo your way through your to do list with a simple choice for each task: do it, delegate it or defer it…. You are ready to start your day in 1-2-3 easy steps.</p>
  
  <p>Your <a href="/?p=feature&f=current">Current</a> list contains all the tasks that you have agreed to and that aren’t blocked, delegated or deferred. That’s a good first step in deciding what to do next. However, sometimes even your <a href="/?p=feature&f=current">Current</a> list can be overwhelming. That is where the Turbo Wizard comes in.</p>
  
  <p>The Turbo Wizard moves you from the top to the bottom of your <a href="/?p=feature&f=workspace">Current</a> list, giving you a view of each task’s details. To filter your Current list down to what you can accomplish today, the Turbo Wizard provides you the following options for each task.</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Do it</strong> – as in “right now.” If you can do the task in two minutes or less, this option takes you to the task <a href="/?p=feature&f=workspace">Workspace</a> to do the task. It also shows a two-minute timer to help you stay focused.</li>
    <li><strong>Leave it</strong> – choose this option if you will need more than two minutes, but you will get to it today.</li>
    <li class="bullets"><strong>Defer it</strong> – use this button if you know you won’t get to it today. When you choose to defer, you will see the following options:</li>
  </ol> 
  <ul style="margin-left: 3em">
      <li><strong>One day, one week, two weeks</strong> – moves the task to your Deferred list. After the selected time, the task will automatically move back into your <a href="/?p=feature&f=current">Current</a> list.</li>
      <li><strong>Other</strong> – this brings up the task calendar, where you can pick a defer date</li>
      <li><strong>Delegate it</strong> – this allows you to edit the task to delegate it to another person and/or another Coord</li>
  </ul>
  <p>… And if the task is <a href="/?p=feature&f=workspace">Private</a></p>
  <ol start="4">
    <li><strong>Someday</strong> – move the task to your someday list.</li>
    <li><strong>Archive</strong> – mark the task done and move it to your done task archive.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete It</strong> – delete the task</li>
  </ol>
