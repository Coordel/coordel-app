  <p>Don't get overwhelmed by the work on your plate. Turbo your way through your to do list with a simple choice for each task: do it, delegate it or defer it…. You are ready to start your day in 1-2-3 easy steps.</p>
  
  <p>Your Current list [LINK TO CURRENT LIST] contains all the tasks that you have agreed to and that aren’t blocked, delegated or deferred. That’s a good first step in deciding what to do next. However, sometimes even your Current list can be overwhelming. That is where the Turbo Wizard comes in.</p>
  
  <p>The Turbo Wizard moves you from the top to the bottom of your Current list, giving you a view of each task’s details. To filter your Current list down to what you can accomplish today, the Turbo Wizard provides you the following options for each task.</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Do it – as in “right now.” If you can do the task in two minutes or less, this option takes you to the task Workspace [LINK TO TASK WORKSPACE] to do the task. It also shows a two-minute timer to help you stay focused.</li>
    <li>Leave it – choose this option if you will need more than two minutes, but you will get to it today. </li>
    <li class="bullets">Defer it – use this button if you know you won’t get to it today. When you choose to defer, you will see the following options:
      <ol type="a">
          <li>One day, one week, two weeks – moves the task to your Deferred list. After the selected time, the task will automatically move back into your Current list.</li>
          <li>Other – this brings up the task calendar, where you can pick a defer date</li>
          <li>Delegate it – this allows you to edit the task to delegate it to another person and/or another Coord</li>
      </ol> 
    </li>
  </ol> 
  <p>… And if the task is Private</p>
  <ol start="4">
    <li>Someday – move the task to your someday list.</li>
    <li>Archive – mark the task done and move it to your done task archive.</li>
    <li>Delete It – delete the task</li>
  </ol>
