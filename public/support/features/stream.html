  <p>Say goodbye to the time-consuming status e-mail. Take action and Coordel will immediately inform everyone involved. Need to see what happened? The Task and Coord stream provide a detailed history.</p>
  <p>As you participate in Coords, you need an easy way to find out when something has happened that affects you. The stream is made up of all the messages and activities from all your Coords. </p>
  <p>When you are looking at a specific Coord, the stream will be filtered to include only messages and activities related to that one Coord. </p>
  <p>The same principle applies to the Task Streams. When you are working in your task lists (current, delegated, blocked, etc), you will see the stream of all your tasks combined, with the latest messages at the top. </p>
  <p>When you are working in a task's <a href="/?p=feature&f=workspace">Workspace</a>, you will see the stream for that task. </p>
  <p>As entries are added to Coord and Task Streams, you will hear a sound that indicates you have a new alert. Once you’ve understood the nature of the alert, you can clear the alert list. Don’t worry, the alert entry is still available for your reference in the actual stream.</p>
