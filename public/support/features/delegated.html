  <p>When you delegate some or much of your work, it’s easy to lose sight of who is doing what for you. Coordel provides effortless tracking of your delegated tasks in one overview.</p>
  <p>Even when are not the Coord responsible, you can delegate a task to someone else. You can track these tasks in the Delegated list as well. </p>
  <p>Coordel provides a built-in delegated Coord for when you delegate a task that isn’t part of any Coord. When you delegate a task that isn’t assigned to a Coord, the Delegated Coord is used automatically. Click on the Delegated selector to see all of the tasks in your Delegated Coord.</p>

  <p>The explicit done process [LINK TO EXPLICIT DONE] works just the same with delegated tasks. You are the responsible and will be able to approve or return tasks when they are marked as done. </p>
