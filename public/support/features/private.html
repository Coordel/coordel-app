  <p>Coordel is not just for coordinating teamwork. When you need to do something that doesn't involve someone else, drop it into your Private list. Private tasks will be shown in your <a href="/?p=feature&f=current">Current</a> list if you have not deferred them to a later date.</p>
  <p>The Private list can also be used to quickly add tasks you will transfer to another Coord later or delegate to someone else.</p>
  <p>You can always run the <a href="/?p=feature&f=turbo">Turbo Wizard</a> on your Private list.</p>
