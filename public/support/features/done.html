  <p>Rather than think you're done and find out later you're not, Coordel provides a built-in agreement process so everyone is clear on what has been completed.</p>
  <p>Coordel enables the delegator and task owner to agree on task <a href="/?p=feature&f=deliverable">deliverables</a>. Sometimes, the task owner thinks the deliverables are done, but the delegator has different or additional expectations. Task completion requires that both agree. When the task owner clicks ‘done,’ the task goes back to the delegator who can either approve it or return it for further work.</p>
