  <p>Coordel is about letting you do the work you do best, with the people who complement you best. Coordel automatically keeps track of past and present team members and shows what they are doing and how well they do it. </p>

  <p>You can use your People list to easily invite others into a Coord. As your People list grows, it becomes your go-to place to find people with the skills you need for a specific Coord you are working on.</p>


  <p>When you are invited to a Coord, everyone involved is added to your People list, if they aren’t already there. Click on a person’s name in your list to view all their tasks in Coords you have in common.</p>

  <p>You will also have access to their e-mail address, phone number and Skype details if they have provided them. You can manage your own personal information in your Preferences pane.</p>

  <p>If a person has received <a href="/?p=feature&f=current">Feedback</a>from others, you will see a number in the shield to the left of their name indicating their average rating. Any positive feedback they have received will also be listed. </p>
