  <p>Coordel is about allowing you do the work you do best, with the people who complement you most. Coordel automatically keeps a list of past and present team members and the feedback they have received.</p>

  <p>You can use your "People" list to easily invite others into a Coord. As your People list grows, it becomes your go-to place to find people with the skills you need for a specific Coord you are working on.</p>

  <p>When you are invited to a Coord, everyone involved is added to your People list, if they aren’t already there. Click on a person’s name in your People list to view tasks within Coords you both have in common.</p>

  <p>You will also have access to their e-mail address, phone number and Skype details if they have provided them. You can manage your own personal information in your "Preferences" pane.</p>

  <p>If a person has received <a href="/?p=feature&f=current">Feedback</a> from others, you will see a number in the shield to the left of their name indicating their average rating. Any positive feedback they have received will also be listed. </p>
