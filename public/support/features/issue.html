  <p>Coordel allows you to raise an issue with a task that was assigned to you. Ownership transfers immediately back to the delegator to clear it. No miscommunication, no confusion.</p>
  <p>Coordel ensures that only one person owns a task at any time. When you discover a problem with one of your tasks, you can raise the issue. You must provide a proposed solution before you can submit it.</p>
  <p>The delegator now owns the task you have flagged. When the issue has been resolved, the delegator can assign the task back to you, after explicitly explaining how and why it has been cleared.</p>
  <p>You can always check what is happening with a task by checking its stream [LINK TO STREAM].</p>
