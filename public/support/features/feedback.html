  <p>Forget formal evaluations. We’re talking about improving as a team, one job at a time. Coordel gives you the opportunity to share lessons learned when you’re done with the work, before moving on to the next one.</p>
  <p>When a Coord with more than two members is marked done, the Coord is moved into a Done list for each person. It stays in their Done list until they provide feedback. </p>
  <p>To provide feedback, each person is asked to “Indicate how much you would like to work with each person again,” a question that is designed to qualify how well individuals work with others and how straightforward and efficient they work.</p>
