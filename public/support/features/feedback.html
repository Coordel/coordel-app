  <p>Forget formal evaluations. We’re talking about improving as a team, one job at a time. Coordel allows you to give immediate feedback to the team when a Coord is finished.</p>
  <p>When a Coord with more than two members is marked "Done", the Coord is moved into a Done list for each person. It stays in their Done list until they provide feedback.</p>
  <p>To provide feedback, everyone is asked to “Indicate how much you would like to work with each person again,” a question that is designed to qualify how well individuals work with others and how straightforward and efficiently they work.</p>
