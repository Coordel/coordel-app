	<h1>Creating Tasks from Email</h1>
	<p>Coordel lets you quickly create a task by sending or forwarding it to task@coordel.me. The subject of the Email is used as the name of the Task and the body text of the email is used as the purpose. Any attachments to the email will be attached to the Task.</p>

	<p>All tasks are created in your Private Tasks List. The strategy is to forward any tasks that require attention to Coordel and then apply the Turbo Wizard to your Private Tasks.</p>
	<p>To delegate a task to someone else, just CC them. The task will be assigned to your Delegated Task List.</p>
