  Based on the amount of work required to complete an Opportunity, Coordel pledges an appropriate number of licenses. Coordel agrees to pay participants who do the work 50% of the revenue generated by those licenses. That payment continues for as long as the member pays the monthly fee on the license. Here is an example:
</p>
<div class="et-custom-list etlist-dot indent">
  <ul class="simple">
    <li>Licenses pledged: 5</li>
    <li>Monthly license fee paid by member: $10</li>
    <li>Monthly revenue: $25 = 5 licenses x $10 per month x 50% commission</li>
    <li>Annual revenue: $300</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>
Any Coordel <a class="c-color-active" href="/register">Registered Member</a> can participate in <a href="/?p=coordel" class="c-color-active">Coordel Opportunities</a>. Coordel will allocate the license rights when the Opportunity is completed based on two variables - feedback provided by other <a href="/?p=feature&f=people" class="c-color-active">People</a> in the <a href="/?p=feature&f=coord" class="c-color-active">Coord</a>,  and the quality of successfully completed <a href="/?p=feature&f=deliverable" class="c-color-active">Deliverables</a>. License allocations are distributed in the order the work is completed and as new licenses are purchased by new members.
