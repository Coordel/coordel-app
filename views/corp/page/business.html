<p>Coordel works for you. By making you more productive and by offering you more opportunity. But that is not all. Coordel works best when you're independent to choose how you invest your time and your money.</p>

<h2>Employees, Contractors, Consultants</h2>
<p>
  Everyone has time. Your opportunity with Coordel is that you can choose to invest your time doing what you love. For every <a class="c-color-active" href="/?p=feature&f=coord">Coord</a> published, Coordel allocates a number of licenses and agrees to pay 50% of the revenue generated by the licenses to the participants who do the work. That payment continues for the life of the licenses allocated. Here is an example:
</p>

  <ul class="simple">
    <li>Licenses allocated: 5</li>
    <li>Monthly license fee: $10</li>
    <li>Monthly revenue: $25 = 5 X $10 X 50%</li>
    <li>Annual revenue: $300</li>
  </ul>

<p>
Any Coordel <a class="c-color-active" href="/register">member</a> can participate in Coordel Opportunities. Coordel will allocate the license rights when the opportunity is completed based on feedback provided by other people in the Coord and quality of successfully completed <a href="/?p=feature&f=deliverable" class="c-color-active">deliverables</a>. Allocations will happen in the order they are completed and as new licenses come available.

<p>Looking to invest? Coordel allows you to invest in opportunities. The amount you invest will be used to contract unassigned work in Coordel opportunities. Your potential return is the same as a time investment. You can invest in as little as a single license or invest across multiple opportunities. One license costs $60 and calculated by multiplying the monthly return by 12 months. Any membership that lasts more than a year will result a return on your investment.</p>
