  For every Coordel Opportunity, Coordel allocates a number of licenses and agrees to pay 50% of the revenue generated by the licenses to the participants who do the work. That payment continues for the life of the licenses allocated. Here is an example:
</p>
  <ul class="simple">
    <li>Licenses allocated: 5</li>
    <li>Monthly license fee: $10</li>
    <li>Monthly revenue: $25 = 5 X $10 X 50%</li>
    <li>Annual revenue: $300</li>
  </ul>

<p>
Any Coordel <a class="c-color-active" href="/register">member</a> can participate in Coordel Opportunities. Coordel will allocate the license rights when the opportunity is completed based on feedback provided by other People in the Coord and the quality of successfully completed <a href="/?p=feature&f=deliverable" class="c-color-active">Deliverables</a>. Allocations happen in the order the work is completed and as new licenses become available.
