<h1>Your Coordel Business</h1>

<p>Coordel works for you. By making you more productive and by offering you more opportunity. But that is not all. Play a part in growing the Coordel community and generate increasing Coordel returns for yourself, automatically and immediately.</p>

<h2>Coordel residual commissions</h2>
<p>When you sell a Coordel license to a business contact, customer or just someone you know, you will earn 25% of that license. There are no forms to fill out or hoops to jump through. When you invite people to become a Coordel member and they convert to a paying membership, you automatically receive 25% of their license fee for as long as the license is active.</p>

<h2>Coordel residual contracts</h2>
<p>Coordel is built by a group of professionals excited about creating a new way of working together. And weâ€™re really only at the beginning of the Coordel journey. Want to become part of making it happen? Coordel allocates 50% of every membership fee to those who contribute to expanding and improving the Coordel community. </p>
